# Local-authority register data

Data for the alpha [local-authority register](http://local-authority.alpha.openregister.org), 
a list of local government organisations in the United Kingdom seeded with data from
legislation and [opendatacommunities.org](http://opendatacommunities.org/).

This is currently a single data file, but the process of establishing a custodian for the register may result in the data being split
to populate four separate registers for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, each with their own custodian.

# Identifier

The local-authority is indexed by the [ISO-3166-2;GB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:GB) three character identifier, where available, or a short ONS code where not.

It is envisaged a separate local-authority-register will contain the boundary for each local-authority, indexed by the [ONS GSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ONS_coding_system) code.

# Maps

This repository also includes a number of [maps](maps) to help migrate references to local authorities found in existing data and documents to the identifiers used by the register.
